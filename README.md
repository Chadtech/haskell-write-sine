## Haskell Write Sine

This is just a repo of my Haskell practice. It prompts the user to input a file name, a frequency, and a duration, and then it writes a stream of audio data of a sine wave at that frequency for that duration. If it had a wav file header, it would be a wav file (but it doesnt).
